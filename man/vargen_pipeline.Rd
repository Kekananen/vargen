\title{Main vargen function, to get the list of variants}
\usage{
vargen_pipeline(vargen_dir, omim_morbid_ids, fantom_corr = 0.25,
  outdir = "./", gtex_tissues, gwas_traits, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vargen_dir}{directory with the following file (can be generated with
\code{\link{vargen_install}})}

\item{omim_morbid_ids}{a vector containing the omim morbid id(s) of the phenotype(s) 
of interest. You can search on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man website
(https://www.omim.org/) or use \code{\link{list_omim_accessions}}}

\item{fantom_corr}{the minimum correlation (z-score) to consider a FANTOM5
enhancer/gene association valid (default: 0.25).
A z-score greater than 0 represents an element greater than the mean, this
means that this association has more correlation than random motifs.}

\item{outdir}{the output directory, some files will be written during the
running of this function}

\item{gtex_tissues}{a vector containing the name of the "signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz"
files. Output from \code{\link{select_gtex_tissues}} can be used.}

\item{gwas_traits}{a vector with the trait of interest (as characters). The list
of available traits can be obtained with \code{\link{list_gwas_traits}}}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, will print progress messages (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
a data.frame with the variants fetched from OMIM, FANTOM5, GTEx and GWAS.
The data.frame will contain the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item chr (chromosome)
  \item pos (position of the variant)
  \item rsid (variant ID)
  \item ensembl_gene_id ("gene id" of the gene associated with the variant)
  \item hgnc_symbol ("hgnc symbol" of the gene associated with the variant)
  \item source ("omim", "fantom5", "gtex" or "gwas")
}
}
\description{
Will get a list of variants related to certain OMIM morbid IDs.
Be aware that some of these variants will not be necessarily associated to the
phenotype. We advise to filter the results by annotation ("CADD phred score",
"snpEff impact" etc...). If you want a smaller list of variants that are all
associated with the disease, then run \code{\link{get_variants_from_phenotypes}}
The variants are fetched from the following sources:
\itemize{
  \item OMIM: get variants on the genes related to the disease
  \item FANTOM5: get the variants on the enhancers of the OMIM genes
  \item GTEx: get variants impacting the expression of the OMIM genes in specific tissues.
  \item GWAS: get variants related to the phenotype of interest from the gwas catalog
}
The pipeline will also annotate the variants using \code{\link[myvariant]{getVariants}}
