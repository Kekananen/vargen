# VarGen

VarGen is an R package designed to get a list of variants related to a disease. It just need an OMIM morbid ID as input 
and optionally a list of tissues / gwas traits of interest to complete the results. You can use your own customised list 
of genes instead of an OMIM ID. VarGen is also capable of annotating the variants to help you rank and identify the most 
impactful ones.

All the coordinates are based on the hg38 version of the human genome.

VarGen is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MCorentin/VarGen "GitHub VarGen page")

## VarGen workflow

This pipeline is centred on the genes linked to the disease of interest in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
(subsequently called the "OMIM genes"). VarGen is designed as a discovery tool, if you want a more specific pipeline see
"VarPhen" in "Alternative pipelines".

VarGen outputs variants from the following sources:
- **OMIM:** Variants located directly on the "OMIM genes".
- **FANTOM5:** Variants located on the enhancers / promoters of the "OMIM genes".
- **GTEx:** Variants associated with a change in expression for the "OMIM genes", in certain tissues. Currently GTEx v7 
and v8 are supported.
- **GWAS catalog:** Variants associated with the phenotype of interest.

The variants are then annotated with [myvariant](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/myvariant.html "myvariant bioconductor package").

## Installation

### Dependencies

VarGen needs the following:
- **R** (tested on version 3.6)
- **An internet connection**
- **The following R libraries:** (The number is the version tested during development)
```` 
    Bioconductor (3.9)      biomaRt (2.40.3)        gtools (3.8.1)         
    gwascat (2.16.0)        jsonlite (1.6)          GenomeInfoDb (1.20.0)

    R.utils (2.9.0)         myvariant (1.14.0)      GenomicRanges (1.36.0)
````

- Optional R libraries (needed for the visualisation functions: *vargen_visualisation* and *plot_manhattan_gwas*):
````
    Gviz (1.28.1)           ggbio (>= 1.32.0)       grDevices (>= 3.6.0)
````

To install the dependencies you can use the following command in R (it might take a while depending on your connection):
````
# If not already installed
install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("biomaRt", "gtools", "GenomicRanges", "gwascat", "jsonlite",
                       "GenomeInfoDb", "IRanges", "httr", "BiocGenerics", "stringr",
                       "utils", "splitstackshape", "ggplot2", "rtracklayer",
                       "R.utils", "myvariant"), dependencies = TRUE)
````
**note:** "R.methodsS3" and "R.oo" will be installed as dependencies of "R.utils"

### Install VarGen with devtools

The easiest way to get VarGen is to install it directly from R using “devtools”:
To install devtools:
````
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "MCorentin/VarGen", dependencies = TRUE)
library(VarGen)
````

### Install VarGen from source

Alternatively you can clone the GitHub repository:
````
git clone https://github.com/MCorentin/VarGen
````
Then open R and install the package script from source:
````
library(utils)
install.packages("./VarGen/", repos = NULL, type = "source")
````

## Preparing the input

### Obtaining the local files

VarGen is fetching data from public databases, it needs the following files (they should all be in the same folder). 
The easiest way to get them is to use the *vargen_install* function from this package. The list of files obtained by 
the function is available below (with their approximate sizes and the links to download them manually).
**note:** The installation can take a while, especially for the GTEx files.

````
vargen_install(install_dir = "./vargen_data", gtex_version = "v8", verbose = T)
````

Alternatively, they can be installed manually (the approximate size of every file is written in parenthesis next to the filename):

 - __enhancer_tss_associations.bed__ (~10 Mb), this is the enhancer to transcript start site association file from FANTOM5. 
 (available at:  http://enhancer.binf.ku.dk/presets/enhancer_tss_associations.bed)
 
 - __hg19ToHg38.over.chain__ (~500 kb), some databases are still using information from the human reference genome "hg19". VarGen 
 will use this file to liftover the information to "hg38" (available at: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/liftOver/hg19ToHg38.over.chain.gz)

- __GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL__ (~1.45 Gb), a folder containing the significant variant gene pairs from the Genotype-Tissues Expression 
database (GTEx) (available at: https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets). v7 and v8 are supported by VarGen.
    
    Direct link for v7: https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v7/single_tissue_eqtl_data/GTEx_Analysis_v7_eQTL.tar.gz

    Direct link for v8: https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v8/single_tissue_qtl_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL.tar

- __gwas catalog file__ (~90 Mb), this is an optional file. Depending on your connection, creating the lastest gwas catalog using 
*makeCurrentGwascat* function can take a long time. You can instead download a gwas catalog file from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/alternative 
and give it as input for the VarGen pipeline. 

**note:** VarGen will use the name of the file to get the extract date, so it needs to be in the format: 
\[filename\]_r**YYYYY**-**MM**-**DD**.tsv

### Getting the OMIM id

The OMIM morbid ID is the starting point of the pipeline, from it VarGen will get the genes associated to the disease. You 
can obtain it from the OMIM website https://omim.org/ or using the *list_omim_accessions* function. In our case we will 
use “obesity leanness included” (OMIM id: 601665).

````
gene_mart <- connect_to_gene_ensembl()
View(list_omim_accessions(gene_mart))

# You can search using list of keywords as well:
View(list_omim_accessions(gene_mart, c("alzheimer", "neurodegeneration")))
````

### Getting the GTEx tissues

This database will be used to get tissue-specific variants that are affecting the expression of the genes related to the 
disease. You can obtain the list of files with the *list_gtex_tissues* function.

````
list_gtex_tissues(gtex_dir = "./vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/")

#>       keywords                     filepaths
#> 1     Adipose_Subcutaneous         vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/Adipose_Subcutaneous.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz
#> 2     Adipose_Visceral_Omentum     vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/Adipose_Visceral_Omentum.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz
#> 3     Adrenal_Gland                vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/Adrenal_Gland.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz
#> 4     Artery_Aorta                 vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/Artery_Aorta.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz
#> ...
````

To select the GTEx tissues of interest you can use the *select_gtex_tissues* function, for our case we will use the 
adipose tissues (subcutaneous and visceral): 

````
adipose_tissues <- select_gtex_tissues("./vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/", "adipose")
adipose_tissues

#> [1] "./vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/Adipose_Subcutaneous.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz"    
#> [2] "./vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/Adipose_Visceral_Omentum.v8.signif_variant_gene_pairs.txt.gz"
````

### Getting the gwas traits

The gwas traits will be used to get associated variants in the gwas catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). 
You can search the available gwas traits by keyword with the *list_gwas_traits* function. Here we are going to use a local 
gwas catalog file (gwas_catalog_v1.0.2-associations_e96_r2019-08-24.tsv). 

````
obesity_traits <- list_gwas_traits("obesity", "./vargen_data")
obesity_traits

#>  [1] "Obesity (extreme)"
#>  [2] "Obesity-related traits"
#>  [3] "Obesity"
#>  [4] "Obesity (early onset extreme)"
#>  [5] "Obesity in adult survivors of childhood cancer exposed to cranial radiation"
#>  [6] "Obesity in adult survivors of childhood cancer not exposed to cranial radiation"
#>  [7] "Bilirubin levels in extreme obesity"
#>  [8] "Type 2 diabetes (young onset) and obesity"
#>  [9] "Obesity and osteoporosis"
#> [10] "Hepatic lipid content in extreme obesity"
#> [11] "Hyperinsulinemia in obesity"
````

## How to use VarGen

### Launching the pipeline

VarGen main entry point is the *vargen_pipeline* function.

The mandatory inputs are:
- The folder with the installed files, "./vargen_data/" in our case (see "Obtaining the local files")
- A OMIM morbid id, “601665” in our case (see "Getting the OMIM id").
- An output directory, where information about the variants and the genes will be written. The default is the current directory “./”.

The optional inputs are:
- A fantom5 correlation threshold, the higher it is, the stricter you are about association between genes and enhancers. 
The default is 0.25
- A list of GTEx tissues (see "Getting the GTEx tissues")
- A list of gwas traits (see "Getting the gwas traits")

Now we can launch the pipeline with all the input data:
````
adipose_tissues <- select_gtex_tissues("./vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/", 
                                       "adipose")

obesity_traits <- list_gwas_traits("obesity", "./vargen_data/")

obesity_variants <- vargen_pipeline(vargen_dir = "./vargen_data/", 
                                    omim_morbid = "601665", 
                                    gtex_tissues = adipose_tissues, 
                                    gwas_traits = obesity_traits, 
                                    verbose = T)
````

You will obtain a data.frame with the list of variants, their position on GRCh38, the ensembl id and hgnc gene symbol of
the gene associated with the variant and the source (omim, fantom5, gtex or gwas).

````
head(obesity_variants)

#  chr     pos         rsid           ensembl_gene_id    hgnc_symbol  source
#> chr2    25160855    rs777983882    ENSG00000115138    POMC         omim
#> chr2    25160866    rs1480805741   ENSG00000115138    POMC         omim
#> chr2    25160871    rs1245939527   ENSG00000115138    POMC         omim
#> chr2    25160872    rs1219237056   ENSG00000115138    POMC         omim
#> chr2    25160877    rs1453226041   ENSG00000115138    POMC         omim
#> chr2    25160879    rs566456581    ENSG00000115138    POMC         omim
````

### Annotating the variants

This pipeline is designed as a discovery analysis, to identify potential new variants, **you should not expect every variants from the pipeline to have an effect on the phenotype**. 
Annotating the variants will help you defining which variants to keep or discard. To annotate the variants you can use 
the *annotate_variants* function with the list of rsids obtained with the vargen pipeline. This uses [myvariant.info](https://myvariant.info/, "myvariant.info main page") 
to annotate the variants and may take some time depending on your internet connection.

The annotation contains:
 - [CADD Phred score](https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/ "CADD main page"): ranging from 1 to 99, based on the rank of each variant relative to all possible 8.6 billion substitutions in the human reference genome.  A higher value means a more deleterious variant. (above 10 means the variant is in the top 10%, above 20 in the top 1%).
 - [fathmm-xf score](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/3/511/4104409 "fathmm-xf manuscript"): between 0 and 1, a higher value means a more deleterious variant. (more confidence closer to 0 or 1)
 - [fathmm-xf prediction](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/3/511/4104409 "fathmm-xf manuscript"): "D" (DAMAGING) if score > 0.5 or "N" (NEUTRAL) otherwise.
 - Annotation type: information about the variant location (eg: coding, non-coding, regulatory region...)
 - Consequence: gives more information on the functionnal effect (eg: REGULATORY, DOWNSTREAM, STOP_GAINED, SPLICE-SITE...)
 - [ClinVar clinical significance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/clinsig/ "Representation of clinical significance in ClinVar and other variation resources at NCBI"): standard to report the clinical significance of certain variants (eg: "benign", "pathogenic", "drug response" etc....). 
 - [snpEff impact](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html "snpEff Manual"): assessment of the putative impact of the variant (HIGH, MODERATE, MODIFIER or LOW).

/!\ Due to the different transcripts for a same gene, some variants will appear more than once with a different annotation, 
this is expected. You can check the variant position on the different isoforms with the *vargen_visualisation* function.

````
obesity_annotation <- annotate_variants(obesity_variants$rsid, verbose = T)

# Merging the output of the annotation with VarGen output, using the "rsid" column
obesity_ann <- merge(obesity_variants, obesity_annotation)

# We advise you to write the variants in a file, so you will not have to run the pipeline again.
write.table(x = obesity_ann, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE,
            file = "./OMIM_601665/vargen_variants_annotated.tsv", sep = "\t")
````

Output after annotation:
![Output after annotation](./images/Example_output_VarGen.PNG?raw=true)

### Filtering the variants

As VarGen is outputting a lot of variants, you may want to filter the results. The filtering strategy is dependent on 
your preferences. VarGen outputs an R data.frame containing information about each variant. You can focus on clinically 
significant variants ("pathogenic", "likely pathogenic" etc...), on variants with a high phred score etc...

You can even combine different filtering, for example we found that keeping all the variants from the gwas catalog and
with clinical significance while removing the variants with a cadd phred score lower than 10 was removing a lot of 
potentially false positive results:
````
vargen_phred_10 <- obesity_ann [obesity_ann$cadd_phred > 10,]
vargen_phred_10 <- vargen_phred_10[!is.na(vargen_phred_10$cadd_phred),]

vargen_clinVar <- obesity_ann [obesity_ann$clinical_significance != "",]

vargen_gwas <- obesity_ann[obesity_ann$source == "gwas",]

#Concatenating the different filtering
obesity_filtered <- rbind(vargen_phred_10, vargen_clinVar, vargen_gwas)	
````

## Alternative pipelines

### VarPhen

A more specific, alternative pipeline is available as part of this package, called "VarPhen", it outputs a smaller list 
of variants, but directly related to the disease of interest. It relies on biomaRt to link variants to phenotypes.

**note:** You will need to specify the columns to merge the results from VarPhen ("redsnp_id") and the annotation ("rsid").
cf: the example below.

![VarPhen workflow](./images/VarPhen_workflow.png?raw=true)

Example with obesity:
````
# First connect to snp ensembl
snp_mart <- connect_to_snp_ensembl()

obesity_phens <- get_phenotype_terms(keyword = "obesity", 
                                     snp_mart = snp_mart)

obesity_varphen <- get_variants_from_phenotypes(phenotypes = obesity_phens, 
                                                snp_mart = snp_mart)

obesity_varphen_annotation <- annotate_variants(obesity_varphen$refsnp_id)

# /!\ contrary to vargen, here you need to specify which columns to merge
# "refsnp_id" for varphen, and "rsid" for the annotation.
obesity_varphen_annotated <- merge(obesity_varphen, 
                                   obesity_varphen_annotation, 
                                   by.x = "refsnp_id", by.y = "rsid")
````

Output example:
![VarPhen output](./images/Example_output_VarPhen.PNG?raw=true)

### Customised list of genes

If instead of an OMIM id you are interested in a specific list of genes, you can use the *vargen_custom* function with a 
list of ensembl gene ids. This take the same input as vargen_pipeline (except the omim id) and follow the same workflow
(variants on genes, promoters, gtex and gwas).

Example:
````
adipose_tissues <- select_gtex_tissues("./vargen_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL/", 
                                       "adipose")

obesity_traits <- list_gwas_traits("obesity", "./vargen_data/")

obesity_custom <- vargen_custom(vargen_dir = "./vargen_data/", 
                                gene_ids = c("ENSG00000155846", "ENSG00000115138"), 
                                outdir = "./", 
                                gtex_tissues = adipose_tissues, 
                                gwas_traits = obesity_traits, 
                                verbose = T)
````

## Tips 

### How to plot the gwas variants

If you want to visualise the variants in a manhattan plot, you can use the *plot_manhattan_gwas* function:
````
gwas_cat <- create_gwas("./vargen_data/")

alzheimer_traits <- c("Alzheimer's disease", "Alzheimer's disease (late onset)", "Alzheimer's disease biomarkers", 
                      "Alzheimer's disease (cognitive decline)")

plot_manhattan_gwas(gwas_cat = gwas_cat, traits = alzheimer_traits)

# Optional: if you want to save the plot as a pdf
grDevices::dev.print(pdf, "./manhanttan_alzheimer.pdf")
````

![Example of manhanttan plot for alzheimer's disease](./images/manhattan_alzheimer.png?raw=true)

The two thresholds, suggestive and significant, correspond to the definition given by Lander and Kruglyak:
````
Lander E, Kruglyak L. Genetic dissection of complex traits: guidelines for interpreting and reporting linkage results. Nat Genet. 1995;11(3):241-7.
````

### How to plot the omim variants

You can use the *vargen_visualisation* function to have an overview of the variants located on the omim genes. Note that 
one variant can be represented multiple times, as it consequence and phred score will be different according to each transcript.

````
# cf: 'Annotating the variants' to create "vargen_variants_annotated.tsv":
obesity_vargen_ann <- read.table(file = "./OMIM_601665/vargen_variants_annotated.tsv",
                                 header = T, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = F)
 
gene_mart <- connect_to_gene_ensembl()
vargen_visualisation(annotated_snps = obesity_vargen_ann,
                     outdir = "./obesity_gviz/", 
                     device = "png", 
                     gene_mart = gene_mart)

````
The plot contains 4 tracks:
 - The chromosome, with a red marker on the gene location
 - The ensembl transcripts
 - The variant consequences, grouped by type (eg: INTRONIC, STOP LOST etc...), each green bar represent a variant
 - The cadd phred score, each dot represent a variant. 

![vargen visualisation](./images/SIM1_ENSG00000112246_GVIZ.png?raw=true)

The **rsid_highlight** parameter allows you to highlight some variants (by rsid) in red:
````
obesity_vargen_ann <- read.table("OMIM_601665/vargen_variants_annotated.tsv")

gene_mart <- connect_to_gene_ensembl()
vargen_visualisation(annotated_snps = obesity_vargen_ann, verbose = T,
                     outdir = "./obesity_gviz/", device = "png", 
                     gene_mart = gene_mart,
                     rsid_highlight = unique(obesity_vargen_ann[obesity_vargen_ann$cadd_phred > 20, "rsid"]))

````
